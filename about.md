# Buttercup Password Manager

Buttercup is an Open-Source password manager built on JavaScript (w/ Typescript) for NodeJS and the Web. It's architecture centers around a **core library**, documented here, and several free applications:

 * [Buttercup for Desktop](https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop)
 * [Buttercup for Mobile](https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-mobile)
 * [Buttercup for the Browser (extension)](https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-browser-extension)

The same core library is used in all cases.
